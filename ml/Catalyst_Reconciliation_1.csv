These are samples and there can be other scenarios and patterns in the data to look for anomalies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Take an action on the breaks by minimicing a conciler even if there are no anomalies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some columns maybe extra than the one mentioned in problem statement. This is normal and we can have many derived columns or unrelated columns in real time data. The AI solution should looks at the one actually needed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
